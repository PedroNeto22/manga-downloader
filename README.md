# Manga Downloader

## Project Description

Manga Downloader is a simple and efficient command-line (terminal) tool developed to streamline the process of downloading manga chapters from the manga page URL. This project is specifically designed to work on the [gekkou scans](https://gekkou.site/) website, providing a quick and easy download experience for manga enthusiasts.

## Disclaimer

  This is my first significant project in Python, and I am still in the early stages of learning the language, with approximately 4 months of study. I apologize in advance if the code has flaws or does not follow best practices. I am always eager to learn and improve, and any constructive feedback is highly appreciated.

## Features

- ### Chapter Download
  - Manga Downloader allows users to view all available chapters for a specific manga, presenting the index of each chapter alongside.

- ### Chapter Download

  - During download, users can specify the start (Download from cap) and end (Until cap) of the desired chapters based on the index provided by Manga Downloader. It's essential to note that the user should inform the range based on this index, not the chapter number.

- ### Organized Folder Structure

  - Upon download, Manga Downloader creates a dedicated folder for the manga in the same location where the program was executed. Within this folder, subfolders are created for each chapter, containing PNG format images of the downloaded manga.
